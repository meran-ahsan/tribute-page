      <article class="biography">
        The Achaemenid Persian Empire (550-330 B.C.) which ultimately ruled over
        23 nations spread across approximately 3,000,000 square miles stretching
        from North Africa to Indus Valley was based on law and order. According
        to Herodotus, even the kings were not allowed to put a man to death for
        an offense. An ideal Persian leader had to be intelligent, decisive,
        just, and a guarantor of civil order. Cyrus II the Great (r. 559-530
        B.C.), the founder of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, set the tone for
        its imperial grand strategy. Tolerance, law, and order were how the
        Persians were to conquer and rule the known world. Disruption of order
        by rebellions and lawlessness were challenges met by the Achaemenid
        kings through a well-trained, organized army and a centralized
        bureaucracy.
        <hr />
        Cyrus ascended the throne of Persia in 559 B.C., and as his
        predecessors, recognized the overlord ship of the neighboring Iranian
        Medes. During the first decade of his reign, Cyrus was interested in
        consolidating his authority over the Persian confederation and the
        sizeable Median Empire.
        <hr />
        In 550 B.C., with support from many in the Median army and nobility, he
        defeated his unpopular grandfather the Median King Astyages, and
        captured their capital Ecbatana. During the second decade of his reign,
        Cyrus consolidated all of Iran, as well as eastern lands such as Marv
        and Samarkand. In 545, the fall of the powerful and wealthy Lydia to
        Cyrus sent a shockwave across the ancient world. Cyrus then turned his
        attention to Babylon.
        <hr />
        On October 10, 539, Cyrus attacked and defeated the Babylonian army
        stationed at Opis on the Tigris. Susa fell next. Sippar was taken
        without a fight. Babylon was captured on October 12th, and ten days
        later Cyrus entered the city.
        <hr />
        According to Cyrus’s declaration known as the Cyrus Cylinder, the
        world’s first known bill of human civil rights, the people held in
        captivity by Babylonian kings were set free to return to their native
        lands. Under this decree, the Jews also returned to their homeland and
        rebuilt their temple. Unfortunately, soon thereafter his beloved wife
        Cassandane died, and Cyrus left for Persia to bury his queen.
        <hr />
        It is unclear what his military activities consisted of during the final
        stages of his reign, but he apparently conducted at least one great
        march to the eastern frontier before he was mortally wounded in 530
        during his campaign against the Iranian nomadic Massagetae tribe. His
        eldest son Cambyses II (r. 530-523 B.C.) succeeded him.
        <hr />
        Cyrus the Great is considered one of the best conquerors and most
        admired leaders of all time. He is the subject of many historical and
        political studies. His life was studied and emulated by other “giants”
        in histories such as Alexander and Caesar. His partially fictional
        biography Cyropaedia by Xenophon was a mandatory read for certain
        degrees in European and early American universities. Many of the
        Founding Fathers of America each had at least one copy of this
        biography.
        <hr />
        Tomb of Cyrus the Great at Pasargadae The Tomb of Cyrus is the final
        resting place of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the ancient Achaemenid
        Empire. The mausoleum is located in Pasargadae, an archaeological site
        in the Fars Province of Iran.
        <hr />
        According to the Father of Modern Political Science, Machiavelli, Cyrus
        was a notable prince because he became “great” based on personal
        ability, not fortune. He created an empire with difficulty but kept it
        with ease based on his character and leadership. In his book Power
        Ambition Glory, internationally-acclaimed American publisher and
        businessman Steve Forbes begin his parallels between great ancient
        leadership and todays global lessons with Cyrus.
        <hr />
        For Iranians, Cyrus is a byproduct of their ancient culture, heritage,
        and upbringing. They are proud to have presented such a man to world
        history. Cyrus the Great is the embodiment of Iranian national identity,
        and his immortality ensures Irans future freedom, greatness, and
        contribution to the advancement of human civilization.
